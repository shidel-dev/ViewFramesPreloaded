viewFrames
==========

ViewFrames is a lightweight JavaScript framework, which treats iframes as a first class citizen of the web. It is a take on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. Using iframes as views, the parent page as a controller, and your server is treated like a filing cabinet serving up static pages. This allows for painless and preformant one page applications.

In addition, viewFrames fixes many of the problems of iframes by matching the features provided by the ‘seamless’ iframe attribute, which has failed to gain traction on critical browsers.</p>
